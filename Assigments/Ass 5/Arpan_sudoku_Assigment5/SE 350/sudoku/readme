// sudoku read me file. 
(i) public Sudoku(int dim) == Work
(ii)public Sudoku(int dim, int[][] square) = Work
(III)public static Sudoku fromFile(int dim, String filename) = 
fromfile = code is correct(i think) but I am not sure where to put file in directory to read it from.
Because I kept on getting error that file is not in directory. So I assume that I am not using the right path 
for the file to be open and read using my fromFile method;
(iv)public static class ParseException extends Exception  = work
(V)public String toString() = work
(vi)public Formula getProblem() := work

(VII)public Sudoku interpretSolutioN() = work
      \\ page 33 of lec 13 from MIT notes
      





// this read me for formula files
public Formula not()     === Code is correct but failing because my output doesn't match the test.
public int getSize() = Work
public Formula or(Formula p)  = Work
public Formula and(Formula p) = work 
public Iterator<Clause> iterator()= work
public ImList<Clause> getClauses() = work 
public Formula addClause(Clause c) = work 
public Formula(Clause c) = work 
public Formula(Variable l) = work
public Formula() = work



Test Not fails in the jUnit test because of  toString details.

Expected				
Problem[
Clause[~c, ~b]
Clause[~c, ~a]]


Actual 
Problem[
Clause[~a, ~c]
Clause[~b, ~c]]
