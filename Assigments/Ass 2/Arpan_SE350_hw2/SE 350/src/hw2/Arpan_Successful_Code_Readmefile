MyLinked.java file info:
public void delete (int k) {} == WORKS
public void reverse () {) == WORKS
public void remove (double item) {} = WORKS
  
ALSO CONVERTED THE TEST TO JUNIT SUCCESSFULLY. ALL MY TEST CASES PASSED IT THE CODE.


AssertExp.java file info below: 
public static double minValue(double[] list) { == WORKS
public static int minPosition(double[] list) { == WORKS
public static int numUnique(double[] list) { == WORKS
public static double[] removeDuplicates(double[] list) { == WORKS


ALSO CREATED TEST CASES FOR ALL THE METHODS AND THEY ALL PASSED SUCCESSFULLY AND ASSERTION WORKS AS WELL:


THIS ASSIGMENT I COMPLETED AND EVERYTHING RUNNING 100%.
